Base MSRP against the Electric Range. From the plot, it is evident that there
is a wide variety of Electric Ranges for a very low values of Base MSRP. There
is a great consistency of the cars except for one that indicates low value of
Electric Range and a very high value of Base MSRP.

# Graph 2
The second graph is a line graph that displays the relationship between the count against the
year. It provides the total number of vehicles counted each year. From the plot, it is evident that the total count has been increasing every year with occasional decrease. There was little to none in terms of growth between 2000 and 2010.
The highest count was experienced after 2020.

# Graph 3
The third graph is a box plot that displays the relationship between the Base MSRP distribution against the
Electric Vehicle type. There are two types of vehicles, the Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) and  Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). From the plot, it is evident that PHEV dominate with some at the furthest point on the Base MSRP scale. 

# Graph 4
The fourth graph displays the distribution of Base MSRP. From the plot, it is evident that they are highly distributed between 60000 - 80000, average between 20000 - 40000 and least between 40000 - 60000.
